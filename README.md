# Introduction
The *WorkaroundUtilities* aim to enable workarounds for program issues. This can mean refreshing the browser on certain events, or killing and restarting a process.

# Get the program
Currently every new source version creates an executable. The recent history can be viewed in the actions: https://github.com/kirni/WorkaroundUtilities/actions
Going into the details of a activity will display the generated artifacts.

# Run the program
Atthe moment it is a hard requirement to have the [appsettings.json](#Configure-the-WorkaroundUtilities) in the same directory as the exe.
